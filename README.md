# coffee sublime snippets
## Collection of Sublime Text 2 snippets related to CoffeeScript

These snippets do no require any learning, simply because they are based on what you type anways.

## Installation (Mac)

You probably have the snippets of the [CoffeeScript-Sublime-Plugin](http://xavura.github.com/CoffeeScript-Sublime-Plugin/) and we'll now remove them because they **do** require learning. (*optional*)

`rm -r ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/CoffeeScript/Snippets`

Next up:

`cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User`
`git clone https://github.com/excellenteasy/coffee-sublime-snippets.git`

That's it, have fun etc.

Note: some of the snippets won't work if you don't add this to your settings file
`"auto_complete_triggers": [ {"selector": "text.html", "characters": "<"}, {"selector": "text.coffee", "characters": "(=-"} ]`
